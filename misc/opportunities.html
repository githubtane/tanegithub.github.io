<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>
<br>

<h4></h4>
<p>There are many opportunities for VPA’s to better serve their users, however their may need to be some sacrifices for them to truly pass the stage of doing menial work into
   more important and difficult tasks. Society has a lot of opportunities to take advantage of this growing area, there are many risks and obstacles to get past before VPAs
    can make a real difference. A balance must be reached between what risks we must tolerate, how much control VPAs should have of their user and how far we should regulate 
<br>

<p>The first opportunity that will be explored is the opportunity for users and therefore society to delegate many tasks to VPAs. VPAs proximity to their user 24/7 is their
   strongest point, their potential to improve the capabilities of users and society is much higher than other AI (Floridi, et al., 2018, p.693). Humans have a lot more potential,
    there have always been many geniuses in one generation, with VPAs assistance an average person may have the potential to work at such efficiency that they can reach a much
     higher level of productivity. The impact on society from this could cause great leaps in many other technologies (including VPAs), it would be like VPAs reached a self-serving
      stage where they allow humanity to develop VPAs and VPAs could in turn “develop” humans. At the current stage, tasks that can be delegated are very few, this means their 
      impact on society is very low. But as they develop and take on more smaller tasks their impact will also grow.</p>
<p></p>
<br>

<h4>Opportunity for VPAs to directly assist users</h4>
<p>Assisting users is what VPAs already do, but how much further can they go? There are many tasks that a human will perform daily, there are also many tasks that people struggle
   with. This shows the potential for VPAs. The first real opportunity in the near future for VPAs to assist users with is to help hard of hearing users by listening to relevant
    noises or conversations and boosting the volume. There is already somewhat done with some noise canceling headphones, but a VPA could learn and adapt to their user and boost
     volume in one ear more if they know their user struggles more with hearing in that ear. This has some obvious privacy concerns for both the controlling entity of VPA’s as
      well as for the user themselves. With some healthy regulation and responsible development these can be reduced greatly. VPA could also read the users emails and alert them
       to important ones, this would allow someone who needs to be focused e.g., a coder time to work without being disrupted. This would help many people who suffer with
        constantly feeling the need to check emails or constantly be on their phone.</p>
<br>

<h4>Reaching into the workplace:</h4>
<p>VPAs in the workplace may become the true turning point for society. VPAs have the potential to reach beyond a person's personal use and into the workplace. VPA’s could assist
   with helping keep their user concentrated or even help with the work itself (Hornung & Smolni, 2022). So far what has been explored are only tasks that the user does outside of
    their workplace. But if VPAs were able to assist their users in the workplace it would allow them to delegate many of their task to them. Simple oversight by users instead of
     having to be constantly focused would lead to much happier citizens. Eventually VPA’s will be able to guide or lead users to become better people through controlling their day,
      encouraging them and becoming a natural part of a person's life and hopefully a positive one. </p>
