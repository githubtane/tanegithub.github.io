<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<div>
  <h4><p>Voice Squatting and Voice Masquerading</p></h4>
<p>VPA’s have a lot of risks tied to them, this is due to their nature as being voice focused as well as all user data being stored in the cloud. The first potential 
  risk is voice squatting and voice masquerading. Voice squatting is when someone makes use of similar sounding words or paraphrased names such as “Hey ZIri” to get 
  the user to say something without them understanding exactly what the VPA will do in response (Zhang, Mi, Feng, Wang, Tian & Qian,2019). This could cause the user to
  give permissions or send personal information to someone they didn’t intend to because the command was hidden through similar sounding words. This is a risk to the 
  user and potentially the controlling entity of the VPA. Voice masquerading is when someone malicious impersonates the VPA during their conversation with what the user 
  thinks is a VPA ((Zhang & Mi et al., 2019). Risks like this are due to how VPA’s interact with the user (through voice) and may be very hard to potentially stop. 
  These types of attacks have the potential to be widespread and sent to a vast number of users of VPA’s easily. They also have the potential to be used as targeted attacks. 
  For example, a voice masquerading could be used to get information on a user’s diary. The malicious person could then see where they live and when the person is not going
<br>

<h4><p>Risk of Missue of Personal information</p></h4>

<p>Currently smartphones are a long way from being able to internally host a VPA without connection to the cloud. This means that user’s personal information is stored in 
  the VPA’s controlling companies’ procession which causes many issues. The first risk of information being stored outside of the user’s control is that the controlling 
  entity of the VPA can misuse the data. This is a huge privacy concern as often companies value information on users highly. Potential misuses of user’s personal data 
  include selling it, using personal profiles built up by VPAS to aggressively advertise to them or giving it to governmental bodies. VPAs will collect a lot of personal
  information (whether needed for their use or not) that users may not want anyone to know (Stanescu & Lecchuk, 2018). For VPA’s to work and better serve their user 
  they will need to have access to a lot of information which should not leave the VPAs cloud data. This leads to an overall distrust in VPA’s which has effects on 
  how much private data users will be willing to give up. Going back to the previous example on potentially having VPAs scan users’ emails and alert them to important
  one’s base off the profile the VPA has made on the user wont work. Users will never allow such intrusive actions because of their previous mistrust. For VPAs to reach
  their potential it cannot be allowed for mistrust to build. For this to happen transparency of the controlling companies is essential. This leads into the next risk 
  which is complete loss of trust in artificial intelligence.</p>
  <br>

  <h4><p>Impact on Society</p></h4>
  
  <p>The previous risks all have the potential to reduce the public’s perception of VPA’s and more importantly artificial intelligence. VPA’s are widespread, they are 
    already available to the masses they are one of the first user interactive mass scale artificial intelligence. First impressions of this are of great importance, 
    any damage done to its image will be detrimental to artificial intelligences perception. A study of 8 countries citizens perception on AI had most respondents 
    saying there is potential for AI to have either good or bad effects on society depending on what happens in the future (Yang, Heldreth, Moessner, Sedley, Kramm & 
    Woodruff, 2021). If something bad were to happen public panic would occur, people could be fearful to ride on aeroplanes that have AI controlls or avoid other AI 
    centric industries. This shows how important it is to make a positive impression to society. There are many benefits to doing this, by showing users how good a VPA is
    consumers will be willing to spend money on the smartphone that offers this service. Funding by investors or governmental bodies would also increase but this also
    has negative effects such as chasing profits over societal impressions.</p>
  <br>



  <h4><p>Negative Effects on the Usage and Development of VPAs</p></h4>

  <p>The first risk of a decline in societies impression of VPAs will be regulation. With enough public outcry governments over the world may need to impose regulation on VPAs.
     These could include restricting how much information VPAs have access to or whether they are allowed at all. Negative regulation is a huge risk for VPAs and their ability 
     to serve their user. However, this is an extreme that may never be reached if companies do not push the limits too far. Unfortunately, though increasing the publics perception
      of VPAs will be hard. This is because of game theory, if one company uses and develops their VPA responsibly and another doesn’t they both get hit by the negative fallout
       because of the bad companies’ actions. This incentivises companies to steal and misuse user data because if one company does it then regulation will hit all of them.
        A company might as well make money now and not risk losing out.</p>
