<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

<h4><p>Evolving to the User or to Help all Users</p></h4>

<p>There are a few choices available when adopting VPA’s such as whether to focus on how to deal with the public or focus on the individual. Current VPA’s don’t offer much<p></p>
   personalization, user profiles are not being built (beyond storing user information). VPAs don’t adjust to their users, the experience offered by a VPA on one person’s <p></p>
   phone is the same as another. This is mainly due to the limited features that VPAs currently have. An example of this in action is Siri, Siri sends data back to cloud for<p></p>
    natural language processing therefore, further building on its public service rather than building a relationship with the user (Imrie & Bednar, 2013). This is an important<p></p>
     choice because a VPA with the ability to adapt to each individual user can offer much more assistance than one which is focused on how to best serve everyone generally.<p></p>
      There is also an option that both are used, the AI is developed personally for each user as well as evolving to help better all users. A benefit of this is that when/if <p></p>
      smartphones become powerful enough to store all the VPAs information it needs and can directly run from it with no interaction to the cloud users will no longer have to<p></p>
       worry about their information being sent to their controlling company. Big steps need to be made to reach this point and there is a lot of time for things to go wrong.</p>
<br>


<h4><p>VPAs Impact on Society</p></h4>

<p>VPA’s can not only help/assist the user they can also help society. This can be achieved by assisting the user to such an extent that their productivity is increased.<p></p>
   By streamlining users’ day/work it can have a positive impact on society (Makridakis, 2017). There is a choice as to whether controlling users to this extent is a good<p></p>
    idea for both trust and humans’ autonomy and if it would be better to instead offload humans work to AI instead. If VPAs got to this stage their importance and usefulness<p></p>
     would be very high. It could be used as a transitional period where VPAs assist users until the point that AI become so advanced, they can do anything humans can do plus<p></p>
      more and “take over”. This would be a good middle ground where AI don’t come in abruptly but have “always” been there helping their user. This may be many years into the<p></p>
       future but is an important choice for when adopting VPAs especially as they rapidly advance.</p>
<br>

<h4><p>If Regulation is Neded to What Extent?</p></h4>

<p>After exploring all the different risks and current populations worry about AI regulation may be needed. The question becomes when does the government regulate and to what <p></p>
  extent. Firstly, when to regulate. By regulating light early can save societies perception on VPA’s and AI in general relatively neutral. It will have negative effects such <p></p>
  as decreasing in research and development into AI and may cause fear among society that they have a potential to do great harm. This of course could all be avoided if companies<p></p>
   didn’t push their luck with exploiting their users. This is occurring now with some regulation already being put in place (Mill & Quintais, 2022) Regulation occurring after<p></p>
    something has gone wrong such as a huge data breach scandal could ruin AI and VPAs image for the foreseeable future. This cant be allowed to happen or VPAs may never go<p></p>
     beyond searching basic information for their user.</p>
<br>


<h4><p>Market Share</p></h4>

<p>When VPAs get widespread adoption, will it be acceptable for one company to control most of the market. Like many business sectors there is often one or a couple big companies<p></p>
   controlling most of the market, if VPAs got to this point should it be allowed? As mentioned previously there are a lot of risks and VPAs have a large potential for misuse,<p></p>
    this would be even more so if one VPA was used by 90% of the people. The control the company could exert would be massive, this is something governments and customers should<p></p>
     keep note of when looking for their next VPA. Adopting a single VPA will be good for offering data for the VPA to use to better itself, but it is likely more important to<p></p>
      ensure a healthy competitive market for VPAs.</p>
