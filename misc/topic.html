<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>

<h4>Definition and Justification</h4>
<p>Virtual private assistants in smartphones (VPA) are AI such as Siri, which can assist the user in their day-to-day life. They are already widespread by not utilized 
	much nor are their capabilities very useful compared to what they can potentially do. Many are based on cloud computing and user data is also stored on the cloud 
	(Chung & Lee, 2018). VPA’s can already help their user with several different tasks such as setting reminders for the user and searching requested phrases and words
	 on the internet. However, in a survey (Dubiel, Halvey & Azzopardi, 2019) found that most users didn’t even know their phone had a VPA or that they did not understand
	  to what extent they could assist them. The study also showed that many users who did know about it chose not to use it citing that they didn’t believe it would make 
	  their life easier. This shows that VPA’s have a lot of potential and may need some marketing for their users to understand how they can help. Currently VPAs do not 
	  have too much impact on society, they are a passing thought that many do not know about. This shows that their potential is much higher than other types of AI but 
	  most AI potential has not been reached yet either.</p>

	  <br>  
<p>This topic was chosen because VPAs are a relatively new technology in an emerging market with the potential to cause great harm as well as immense good. VPAs may act on
	 behalf of their user, doing menial tasks such as responding to emails, answering, or alerting their user to many things in their surroundings. In the future they may
	  even do much more which will be discussed in the opportunities section.</p>
<br>

<h4>Importance:</h4>
<p>For VPA’s to be able to better serve users they will need more permissions and even potentially the ability to record and listen constantly. However, there is a large
	 decline in trust of institutions (Sohlberg, Ghersetti & Johansson, 2020). This leads to the problem of would a customer purchase a phone that has such an intrusive 
	 software that potentially spies and keeps a record on them. These topics will be explored later in the assignment but show how important VPAs are. The topic is 
	 important because VPA’s will likely be first AI that normal citizen will be able to interact with. Already there is an abundance of AI in the world, but your average>
	  citizen does not have access to it, if VPAs were to fail or end in a large scandal they could tarnish AI’s image. AI already has a negative connotation with it, many
	   fiction stories feature AI and the negatives they could pose. If VPAS experience ends up being negative, then societies perception of AI will inevitably become 
	   negative as well. This could set back AI in research or potentially lead to very restrictive regulation will would crush the potential for VPA to serve their user.
