<h1>Implications of Virtual Private Assistants in Smartphones (VPA):</h1>
<h1>How Virtual Private Assistants in Smartphones Can Better Serve Their User and Their Impact on Society</h1>

<br>
<br>
</ul><p>We decided on a top for Virtual Private Assistance in smartphones. This is a subset of artificial intelligence
but we narrowed it down to fit the requirements. This website details assignment 3, through out the website you 
can find tabs to each of the required aspects. The focus of our assignment is to show the impact that VPA's have on society.
We did this by first outlining what our choosen topic was and why we thought it was important. There were also many opportunities
we explored such as helping users be more productive during work hours. There were many risks that we outlined such as risks of missue of
that personal informantion. Finally we explored the choices available when adopting VPA's.
